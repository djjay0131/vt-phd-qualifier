\section{Literature Assessment}
\label{sec:literature}

% ~3 pages total
% Synthesize the 6 selected papers into a coherent framework
% Don't just summarize each paper individually -- find themes, connections, gaps

% Suggested organization: group papers by theme/contribution area
% Adjust subsections based on how the 6 papers cluster

\subsection{Background and Foundations}
\label{sec:lit-background}

% Key foundational concepts that the papers build upon
% LLM capabilities, agent architectures, tool use, etc.

TODO: Write foundational background connecting the surveyed papers.

\subsection{Agentic Architectures and Frameworks}
\label{sec:lit-architectures}

% Papers addressing agent design, multi-agent systems, orchestration
% How agents are structured, communicate, and coordinate

TODO: Synthesize papers on agentic architectures and frameworks.

\subsection{Knowledge Representation and Reasoning}
\label{sec:lit-knowledge}

% Papers on knowledge graphs, retrieval-augmented generation, structured knowledge
% How agents acquire, store, and reason over knowledge

TODO: Synthesize papers on knowledge representation in agentic systems.

\subsection{Autonomous Research and Discovery}
\label{sec:lit-research}

% Papers on AI-driven research, scientific discovery, research automation
% How agents contribute to the research process

TODO: Synthesize papers on autonomous research capabilities.

\subsection{Synthesis and Gap Analysis}
\label{sec:lit-synthesis}

% Tie the themes together
% Identify what's missing, what's contradictory, what's promising
% This sets up the research proposal

TODO: Identify gaps, contradictions, and open problems across the surveyed work.
