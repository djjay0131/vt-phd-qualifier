# Project Brief: VT PhD Qualifier

## Core Objective

Write and submit a **5-6 page IEEE conference-format paper** for the Virginia Tech PhD qualifying examination. The paper is a literature survey of 6 selected papers with a research proposal extending the surveyed work.

## Qualifier Requirements

Source: https://chbrown13.github.io/qualifier.html

### Paper Selection
- **6 papers** of student's choice
- At least **3 must come from the provided reading lists**
- Papers should be highly relevant to research area
- Papers should form the foundation for future research work

### Written Component (5-6 pages, IEEE format)
- **Abstract + Introduction** (~1 page): Motivate the research area, define scope
- **Literature Assessment** (~3 pages): Insightful survey synthesizing the 6 papers into a coherent framework
- **Research Proposal** (~1 page): Propose research extending the surveyed work
- **Conclusion**: Summarize and connect to future directions
- **References**: Do NOT count toward page limit

### Oral Component
- **15-minute presentation** + 5 minutes Q&A
- Focus: High-level takeaways, research overview, lessons learned, connections, future directions

### Key Dates
- Paper list due: January 20
- Reading list commitment: January 30

## Research Focus Area

**Agentic AI for Autonomous Research** -- focusing on how LLM-driven agents can automate and augment the research process, with emphasis on knowledge graphs, multi-agent systems, and autonomous discovery.

### Uploaded Papers (2 of 6)
1. **Agentic Knowledge Graphs for Research Progression** (`files/`)
2. **Research4Agents** (`files/`)

### Remaining Papers (4 of 6)
- TBD: Must select at least 3 total from provided reading lists

## Deliverables

1. **IEEE Conference Paper** (5-6 pages) -- `proposal/main.pdf`
2. **Presentation** (15 minutes) -- to be created later
3. **Published PDF** via GitHub Pages

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 6 papers selected (3+ from reading lists)
- [ ] Literature synthesized into coherent framework (not just summaries)
- [ ] Research proposal flows from identified gaps
- [ ] IEEE format, 5-6 pages (excluding references)
- [ ] Paper compiles cleanly
- [ ] Published to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Presentation prepared (15 min)
