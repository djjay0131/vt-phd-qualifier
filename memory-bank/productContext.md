# Product Context: VT PhD Qualifier

## Problem Statement

The PhD qualifier requires producing a literature survey that demonstrates:

1. **Deep Understanding** of 6 selected papers in the research area
2. **Synthesis** -- not just summarizing papers individually, but finding themes, connections, and gaps across the body of work
3. **Research Vision** -- proposing how to advance the research forward based on the survey
4. **Academic Communication** -- writing in IEEE conference format with proper citations and structure

## Research Area: Agentic AI for Autonomous Research

### Why This Area?
- LLM-driven agents are rapidly transforming how research is conducted
- Knowledge graphs provide structured representations for agentic reasoning
- Multi-agent systems enable complex research workflows
- Autonomous discovery agents can accelerate scientific progress
- This area directly connects to the student's research interests

### Key Themes Across Papers
- Agentic architectures and LLM-based autonomous agents
- Knowledge graph construction and reasoning
- Research automation and scientific discovery
- Multi-agent coordination and tool use

## Solution Approach

### Paper Structure
1. **Abstract + Introduction** (~1 page): Frame agentic AI research landscape
2. **Literature Assessment** (~3 pages): Synthesize 6 papers by theme, not by paper
3. **Research Proposal** (~1 page): Extend surveyed work with a concrete proposal
4. **Conclusion**: Tie together and point to future work

### Key Principles
- **Synthesize, don't summarize**: Group papers by theme, find connections
- **Identify gaps**: What's missing? What's contradictory? What's promising?
- **Propose concretely**: Research proposal should be specific and grounded in the gaps
- **Write for the committee**: Balance technical depth with clarity

## Success Metrics

- **Coherence**: Paper reads as a unified argument, not 6 book reports
- **Insight**: Identifies non-obvious connections and gaps
- **Feasibility**: Research proposal is concrete and achievable
- **Quality**: IEEE format, proper citations, clean compilation
- **Page target**: 5-6 pages (excluding references)
