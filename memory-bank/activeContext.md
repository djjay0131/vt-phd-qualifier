# Active Context

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-20

## Current Work Phase

**Phase 1: Paper Setup & Paper Selection**

Project infrastructure complete. LaTeX template, CI/CD pipeline, and modular section files created. Next: finalize paper selection, read papers, begin writing.

## Current State

**Project Status:**
- Repository initialized with full documentation system
- LaTeX proposal structure created (IEEE conference format)
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated PDF build and GitHub Pages deploy
- 2 of 6 papers uploaded (`files/`)
- 4 more papers needed (3+ total from reading lists)
- All section files have TODO placeholders ready for content

**Paper Selection (2/6):**
1. Agentic Knowledge Graphs for Research Progression
2. Research4Agents
3. TBD (must be from reading list)
4. TBD
5. TBD
6. TBD

## Immediate Next Steps

**Priority Tasks:**

1. **Select remaining 4 papers** - at least 1 more from reading lists (need 3+ total from lists)
2. **Read and annotate all 6 papers** - extract key themes, methods, contributions
3. **Create thematic outline** - group papers by theme for literature review
4. **Write literature review** - synthesize papers, identify gaps (~3 pages)
5. **Write research proposal** - extend surveyed work based on gaps (~1 page)
6. **Write introduction** - motivate area, define scope (~0.5-0.75 pages)
7. **Write conclusion** - summarize, connect to future work
8. **Write abstract** - last, after all content is written
9. **Polish and verify** - page count, formatting, citations

## Recent Decisions

### Decision 1: Documentation Structure
- **Date:** 2026-02-20
- **Decision:** Adopt memory-bank + construction folder from construction-ai-proposal
- **Rationale:** Proven structure for maintaining context across sessions

### Decision 2: IEEE LaTeX with Modular Sections
- **Date:** 2026-02-20
- **Decision:** Use modular LaTeX section files (same pattern as construction-ai-proposal)
- **Rationale:** Easier to edit individual sections, proven workflow

### Decision 3: GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Date:** 2026-02-20
- **Decision:** Automated PDF build + GitHub Pages deployment on push to main
- **Rationale:** Easy sharing, automated build verification, public URL for committee

## Key Patterns and Preferences

### Writing Patterns
- Synthesize papers by theme, not one-by-one summaries
- Every claim backed by citation
- Research proposal flows from gap analysis
- Write abstract last

### Documentation Patterns
- Update activeContext.md after every significant change
- Keep progress.md current with task completion

## Open Questions

1. **Remaining papers** - Which 4 additional papers to select?
2. **Reading list papers** - Which papers come from the provided reading lists?
3. **Presentation** - When to start preparing the 15-min oral component?

## Reference Materials

- Memory Bank: `memory-bank/`
- Qualifier Requirements: https://chbrown13.github.io/qualifier.html
- Proposal Source: `proposal/sections/`
- Reference Papers: `files/`

## Notes for Next Session

- Read ALL memory-bank files on context reset
- Check phases.md for current phase status
- Priority: select remaining papers and begin reading/annotating
